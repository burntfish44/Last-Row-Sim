## Info

A sim of OSRS ToA P4 wardens, based on https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tombs_of_Amascut/Strategies#The_Wardens

Options currently include:
  - boss attack toggles and endless mode
  - player health/weapon and a couple UI toggles
  - sound options

Features not included in the initial release, since I wanted to get early feedback, but would like to include at some point:
  - zebak path level for faster projectiles
  - simulated latency
  - more tile marking options (destination tile, hovered tile)
  - prayer point management
  - keris healing option (equip & spec bubble)
  - more game modes (extra hard mode, low prayer, etc)
  - more player options (weapons, starting health, starting supplies, etc)
